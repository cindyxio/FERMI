The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope is used to detect high-energy photons produced by astronomical objects, among which are gamma-ray-emitting BL Lacertae objects or BL Lacs. BL Lacs have beamed jets of matter pointed directly towards the Earth, and this is worthy of noting because jets usually stream from black holes. However, BL Lacs are known for being difficult to identify due to their spectra's lack of diagnostic features, since a spectrum shows the relative amount of light emitted by an object at different energies.

**Thus, the goal of this analysis is to effectively classify BL Lacs using a dataset derived from Fermi LAT 10-Year Point Source Catalog (4FGL)**, as well as determine the predictive variables most useful for said classification.**
